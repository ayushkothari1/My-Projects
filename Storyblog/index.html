        <h2>Nothing to See Here...</h2>
        <p>
          It was a regular Wednesday afternoon, or so it seemed. Nothing
          Sharma—yes, that was really his name—sat in the back of the classroom,
          minding his own business. He was used to the snickers, the whispered
          comments, and the occasional jabs about his name. After all, "Nothing
          Sharma" wasn't exactly something you’d find in a baby name book. But
          he had learned to shrug it off. <a class="hide">...Read More</a>

            However, his patience was wearing thin. The usual tormentor, a boy
            named Kukurman (a nickname he wore proudly, like a badge of honor),
            was in full swing today. Kukurman, with his self-proclaimed "dogman"
            persona, had decided that it was time to turn up the heat. Today,
            the teasing was relentless. Every time someone asked him his name,
            Kukurman would chime in with an exaggerated "Nothing Sharma!"
            followed by a ridiculous laugh. Nothing’s blood began to boil. It
            was one thing to make fun of his name, but today it felt like
            something deeper, something more personal. The more Kukurman
            laughed, the more Nothing's tolerance thinned. So, Nothing decided
            to take matters into his own hands. He was done letting Kukurman get
            away with it. "I'm going to end this once and for all," he muttered
            under his breath. After class, he saw Kukurman walking alone. The
            perfect opportunity. Nothing ran toward him, determined to show him
            who he was messing with. But just as he reached Kukurman, disaster
            struck. Kukurman, startled, slipped on a random puddle of water,
            crashing into a nearby wooden fence. It all happened too fast to
            process. Nothing stopped in his tracks, his heart racing. Kukurman,
            now face down, wasn't moving. His eye... his eye was gone. In that
            instant, everything shifted. Nothing was no longer angry; he was
            horrified. He rushed to his side, trying to help, but the damage was
            done. The ambulance came, but by then it was too late. Kukurman was
            90% blind in one eye, and the damage was irreversible. Nothing sat
            there, paralyzed, watching his classmate being carried away. He had
            gone from being the victim of jokes to the perpetrator of an
            unimaginable tragedy. Weeks went by. Nothing couldn't shake the
            image of Kukurman, his one eye bandaged, his speech slurred and
            weak. The guilt gnawed at him constantly. The students at school
            weren’t kind, either. Rumors spread that he had intentionally harmed
            Kukurman, that it had all been part of some twisted revenge plot.
            Even those who had mocked him before now whispered behind his back,
            claiming he was a danger. But the worst part? Kukurman, despite
            everything, still mocked Nothing every chance he got. Even with half
            his vision, Kukurman would grin with his lopsided smile and say,
            "Nothing Sharma." His words, like daggers, dug deeper into Nothing’s
            already fractured soul. One day, as Nothing sat in the cafeteria,
            contemplating how far this had gone, he saw Kukurman across the
            room, still making fun of him to his friends. "Nothing Sharma!" he
            yelled with what remained of his voice. This time, it wasn’t just a
            name—it was a battle cry. Nothing’s blood boiled, but it wasn’t the
            same anger. It was... confusion. His mind raced. "How can he still
            do this after everything?" At that moment, everything clicked. It
            was all part of a bigger joke. A dark, twisted comedy, in fact.
            Nothing realized that everything—every jab, every injury, every
            outburst—was just a performance, a bit of a skit that no one had
            prepared for. He stood up, taking a deep breath. His name, his own
            tormentor, and his own guilt were all just pieces of a larger
            narrative. A narrative that he controlled now. With a smirk on his
            face, he walked over to Kukurman and sat next to him. Kukurman
            stopped mid-sentence, eyes wide, as if the roles were reversing.
            "What do you want, Nothing?" he croaked. Nothing leaned in, and with
            a deadpan expression, said, "Well, I was trying to sort things out
            with you, but since you keep making fun of me… let's just say I'm
            about to flip the script." Kukurman looked confused, but he didn't
            respond. Nothing grinned. "I’m done playing the victim.</span
